Simple python script that reads a list of the 1000 largest US cities from https://gist.github.com/Miserlou/11500b2345d3fe850c92/ then prints all the cities that have the same consonants in both the city name as well as the state name.

This is in answer to NPR's Sunday Puzzle show presented on November 17, 2019. The problem statement is: "This week's challenge comes from Janet McDonald of Baton Rouge, La. The city of Mobile, Ala., has the interesting property that the name of the city has exactly the same consonants as its state (M, B, and L), albeit in a different order. What is the next-largest U.S. city for which this is true?"
